Segmentation of cutaneous melanoma cancer using color image processing.

Nowadays, computer-aided diagnosis of various skin cancers, including melanoma, in the early stages has become possible through the use of surface reflectance microscopy, also known as dermoscopy. Melanoma is a rare but highly dangerous type of skin cancer that arises from melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing the pigment melanin. Early detection of melanoma is crucial, as it can be successfully treated if diagnosed in its early stages.

The objective of this project is to propose an automated segmentation method for separating melanoma skin lesions from simple color images using digital image processing techniques. The method aims to extract various features of the skin lesion, including boundary features, diameter, color information, symmetry, and overall shape. These features enable the accurate delineation of the melanoma lesion.

The proposed method has been tested on a set of real lesion images, and successful results are presented in this report. By automating the segmentation process, this method offers a time-efficient and reliable approach for diagnosing melanoma and other skin cancers. Early and accurate segmentation can assist dermatologists and healthcare professionals in making timely and effective treatment decisions for patients with skin cancer.
